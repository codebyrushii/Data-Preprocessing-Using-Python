# Data-Preprocessing-Using-Python
Data-Preprocessing-Using-Python
Overview
This project demonstrates essential data preprocessing techniques using Python, primarily leveraging the pandas and NumPy libraries. Data preprocessing is a critical first step in any data analysis or machine learning pipeline, helping to clean, transform, and prepare raw data for further exploration and modeling.

Features
Loading data from CSV files using pandas

Handling missing or irrelevant data columns (e.g., dropping IDs)

Exploring dataset statistics and unique values to understand data distribution

One-hot encoding categorical features to convert them into numeric format suitable for machine learning models

Grouping and engineering categorical reason codes into meaningful feature sets

Datetime conversion and extraction of time-based features (month, day of week)

Data type conversions for clean and consistent data

Exporting cleaned data to CSV for use in downstream tasks

Benefits
Simplifies raw data into structured and model-ready format

Enhances feature interpretability by categorizing and grouping relevant fields

Enables temporal feature analysis via date transformations

Provides a reusable and customizable preprocessing pipeline for absenteeism or similar datasets

Getting Started
Install required libraries: pip install pandas numpy

Place your dataset CSV file (e.g., "Absenteeism-data.csv") in the project folder

Run the preprocessing script to generate a cleaned output CSV

Use the cleaned dataset for machine learning or analysis projects
